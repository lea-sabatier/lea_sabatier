This folder contains the code to generate an analytical report on the Brazilian company Olist using Streamlit. For your information, it is written in French. 

The report has been split into several tabs: context, customer service, partners, finance, recommendations and bibliography. 

### Streamlit App Structure


### Tabs
**Context** 

### Deployment of the Streamlit App
In order to publish the application online, we need 2 files. The first file is the python script. The second file is a text file (requirements.txt) containing all the versions of the libraries used in the script. 
Then we need to put these 2 files in the same folder in a GitHub repository.
